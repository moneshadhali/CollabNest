//Context lets components pass information deep down without explicitly passing props.
//Its able to access app data through 'children' due to 'SocietyContextProvider' being wrapped around index.js

//useReducer is used to manage the 'Context'
//useReducer is similar to useState. 'state' contains the data
//and dispatch make changes to data by passing in parameters
//1 parameter is the type of change being made (CRUD)
//2 parameter is the new data being passed
//The parameter and arguments are called 'action'
//when dispatch triggers the societyReducer function which will update the documents/website

//QUESTION: Whats ...state? why do we add the dots?
//this SocietyContext sits on top off App.js
